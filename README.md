In this repository all sources and tools required to implement the RAIFES RV32IM RISC-V core on a Digilent Nexys A7 Xiling FPGA board  are given. Also implementation, programming and debugging is explained in a short tutorial covering also the installation and setup of the software tools on Windows.

The RAIFES core is based on a RISC-V RV32IM processor core developed by Fraunhofer IMS. 

The main objective is to provide information on the first steps for further analysis and development of future projects. As use case, the Configurable Accelerator Engine for Convolution Operations (CAECO) has been integrated into the Raifes RISC-V RV32IM processor as an AI(ML intellectual property (IP) core for the evaluation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. However, the Raifes core can be used or expanded for other purposes, e.g. cryptographic accelerators.
